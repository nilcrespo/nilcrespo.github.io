## What I Build

<div class="impact-grid">
  <article>
    <h3>Research to Real-World Deployment</h3>
    <p>
      PhD research at Deutsche Sporthochschule Koln focused on automated 3x3 basketball tracking
      and open data infrastructure for reproducible sports AI.
    </p>

  <article>
    <h3>Computer Vision at Scale</h3>
    <p>
      Visual Computing Developer at AiBall, improving player and ball tracking in padel through
      model optimization, camera calibration, and cloud-native processing.
    </p>
  </article>
  <article>
    <h3>Analytics That Coaches Use</h3>
    <p>
      Built dashboards, warehouses, and scouting tools that convert complex models into
      tactical insights for teams and performance staff.
    </p>

## Focus Areas

- **Sports Computer Vision:** player and ball detection, trajectory extraction, single-camera setups.
- **Machine Learning for Performance:** predictive modeling, event analytics, and tactical benchmarking.
- **Data Engineering for Sports:** data flows, scraping pipelines, relational models, and S3-scale storage.
- **Decision-Support Interfaces:** web dashboards and reporting tools for analysts, coaches, and staff.

## Current Priorities

1. Building robust 3x3 basketball tracking models under realistic constraints.
2. Expanding open-source sports datasets for reproducible research.
3. Delivering end-to-end AI products from ingestion to analyst-facing visualization.
