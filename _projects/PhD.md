This project focuses on building robust, reproducible tracking systems for **3x3 basketball** in realistic capture conditions.

## Scope

- Develop deep learning and machine learning models for automated player and ball tracking.
- Extract trajectories and game events from single-camera recordings.
- Build methods that are stable across tournament environments and camera variability.

## Applied Collaboration

- Direct collaboration with analysts and coaches from the **German Basketball Federation (DBB)**.
- Model design decisions shaped by real tactical questions, not only benchmark performance.

## Dataset Contribution

- Leading the development of a large-scale **open-source 3x3 tracking dataset**.
- Primary goal: enable reproducible sports AI research and faster experimentation across teams and labs.
