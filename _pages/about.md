I am a data scientist and computer vision researcher specialized in applied AI for sports.  
My work sits at the intersection of machine learning research, software engineering, and tactical decision support.

I currently work in two complementary environments:

- **Deutsche Sporthochschule Koln** as a PhD researcher, developing AI-driven tracking and analytics for 3x3 basketball.
- **AiBall (Arcvi)** as a Visual Computing Developer, improving player and ball tracking pipelines for padel with scalable cloud infrastructure.

Before these roles, I worked across data science and analytics positions at HP, Ball&Stats, and Barcelona Dragons, building data products and decision systems for competitive environments.

My core motivation is simple: build AI systems that are not only accurate in notebooks, but truly useful in the daily workflow of coaches, analysts, and technical teams.
